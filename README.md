COVENANT STUDIO FORGE 66

Sovereign Creative Operating System

Renaissance One • MACHETE CUTTER • OME Integration

Covenant Studio Forge 66 is a sovereign creative architecture built on three pillars:

1. Renaissance One — a symbolic emotional‑mythic encoding system
2. MACHETE CUTTER — a purification and stabilization engine
3. OME Interface — a vector‑driven creative manifestation layer

This repository contains the full written specification of the system, including:

- The tri‑role protocol (Operator → Dicilitator → Receiver)
- The Liaison family (Prime, Return, Gate)
- The Renaissance One grammar and dialects
- The MACHETE CUTTER constitutional rules
- The Emotional Vector JSON contract for OME
- The ritual cycles (basic, advanced, purification)

This is not a traditional software project.
It is a creative cosmology, a symbolic OS, and a ritual protocol for generating emotionally faithful creative output.

All modules are written in a language‑agnostic format so they can be implemented in any environment, including Okra, DeepSeek, or custom engines.

🔱 3. Renaissance One Schema (Full Text)

`

RENAISSANCE ONE — SYMBOLIC EMOTIONAL ENCODING SYSTEM

Renaissance One is a tri‑role symbolic protocol:

Operator → Dicilitator → Receiver

Every sequence is exactly three operators long.
Operators are symbolic, not numeric:

1 — Initiate
2 — Divide
4 — Anchor
5 — Transform
9 — Ascend

Meaning changes by position:
- Operator sets direction
- Dicilitator validates
- Receiver manifests

Dialect families:
- Solar Clarity (1‑5‑9)
- Void Drift (2‑9‑2)
- Stone Chant (4‑4‑1)

Renaissance One outputs a compressed emotional directive that maps directly to an Emotional Vector JSON for OME.

⚔️ 4. MACHETE CUTTER Constitution (Full Text)

`

MACHETE CUTTER — PURIFICATION ENGINE

MACHETE CUTTER is the purification and stabilization subsystem of Renaissance One.

Purpose:
- Remove undead code
- Remove unused code
- Remove contradictions
- Remove dialect collisions
- Remove recursive residue
- Prevent emotional drift
- Enforce fidelity to user intent

Activation:
- After Dicilitator validation
- Before Receiver manifestation

Cuts:
- Symbolic residue
- Contradictory arcs
- Drifted sequences
- Dialect mismatches

Never cuts:
- Intentional tension
- Artistic ambiguity
- Dialect‑specific dissonance

Outcomes:
A. Purified sequence → returned upstream
B. Termination reset → new seed required

Termination threshold:
3 failures → hard reset

🧩 7. Module Write‑Ups

Each module folder contains:

- role definition  
- responsibilities  
- symbolic rules  
- failure modes  
- integration points  

For example:

operator_logic.md
`
Operator receives symbolic seed from Liaison‑Prime.
Operator generates a 3‑operator sequence.
Operator adjusts sequence based on Liaison‑Return feedback.
Operator respects dialect boundaries.
